# Project Desciption

Our task fosters a plotting apparatus that creates graphs for the CO2 and CH4 information for various areas all throughout the planet. It shows the varieties in the degree of ozone harming substance and how they impact the enivronment. The current highlights of the instrument includes the availability of indicators for the global map which shows districts that are under the danger of a dangerous atmospheric devation, capacity to drift through focuses on the guide, capacity to create charts that show local data of CO2 and CH4, and capacity to download the CSV documents of CO2 and CH4.

# Model Description

This is source code will give you all an overview of what our project is.

## Our code is divided into four sections :

### • Home page : Initially the home page is displayed which contains the choice to be diverted to our first and primary part of the code which shows the worldwide map with pointer levels and information.

### • Global Maps : The Global map gives a visualization of the green house gas emission rate in different regions. Red Indicators convey that the region has high mean rate and would be under threat if the same rate continues in the coming days. Green Indicators convey that the region has fair mean rate of greenhouse emission and the current level(in the past 24 hours) hasn't crossed the threshold limit. Moreover, by hovering through any region the user would be able to access additional data such as the mean rate of greenhouse gas emission (CO2 and CH4) in the past 30 days and also the status of greenhouse gas emssion rate in the past 24 hours(if the emission level passes beyond the threshold limit it would notify a red alert for the place).
